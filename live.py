"""
Look at websocket-test-live.py. It seems to be a better alternative to this.

The way this works is a separate thread is assigned to get new values and store them to a global variable. 
This is done on a set interval. Completely separate to this, each client has its OWN set interval, which, when 
triggered, makes it request a new graph/page from the server. AFAIK, there is no way to "push" this update from the
server to the device, meaning all devices will be slightly out of sync, but always by less than the update value, which
can be very low (<1 s). The frequency at which data is received and stored CAN BE DIFFERENT. 

Basically:
- other thread updates data on its own and on its separate frequency, living its own life
- Browser 'CLIENT_SIDE_REFRESH_RATE' runs out, so it sends "data-collect-interval" to the script.  
- Script receives this and replies with "shared-data-update", sending the new data to the client. POST over.
- Client recieves this and makes a new POST request, "shared-data-update". 
- TWO Callbacks on the script pick this up, and send TWO SEPERATE responses, one to update text, another to update graphs.
Every cycle, 3 post requests are made.
Now, this may be bad for bandwith, since every datapoint, like all of them,
